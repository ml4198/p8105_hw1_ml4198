## Problem 1


```{r df_create}
problem1_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
  vec_char = c("this", "is", "a", "character", "vector", "of", "length", "at", "least", "ten"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "red", "blue", "blue", "yellow", "red", "red", "blue", "blue", "yellow"))
)

problem1_df

mean(problem1_df$x)
mean(problem1_df$vec_logical)
mean(problem1_df$vec_char)
mean(problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

Mean of x and vec_logical can be taken, however mean of character and factor vectors is not available.

```{r as.numeric}
as.numeric (problem1_df$vec_logical)
as.numeric (problem1_df$vec_char)
as.numeric (problem1_df$vec_factor)
```

The logical and factor functions can be converted to numeric values, however character function cannot.

```{r convert}
as.numeric (problem1_df$vec_logical) * (problem1_df$x)
as.factor (problem1_df$vec_logical) * (problem1_df$x)
as.numeric (as.factor (problem1_df$vec_logical)) * (problem1_df$x)
```

## Problem 2


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
